## 💼 About Me

I'm a data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights that drive decision-making. With an MBA in Business Analytics (expected April 2025) and certifications in Google Data Analytics and Tableau, I bring both business acumen and technical skill to the table.

I specialize in using SQL, Excel, and Tableau to analyze data, visualize trends, and support business growth strategies. I'm always curious, always learning, and always ready to dig into the data.
